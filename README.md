# Soda

If you like rust but hate having to worry about the ownership and borrowing
rules slowing down the development process, this is the language for you. Soda
aims to be an interpreted, garbage collected version of Rust, so you can enjoy
the nice syntax and language features of Rust without the hastle of the borrow
checker.

Let's face it: you love Rust because of its excellent iterator abstractions,
sum types, error handling, trait system, and all of the other features that
make the language such a pleasure to use. Sometimes, you want those features,
but you don't want all of the low-level stuff that comes with it. That's where
Soda steps in. I got you.

To do items:

- Implement proper value system
- Improve error messages
